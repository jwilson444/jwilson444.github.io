# Clinical & Volunteer Experience

**Medical Assistant and Scribe**  
_Intermountain Heart Institute – Utah Valley Region_  
_Oct 2021 – Jan 2025_  
While maintaining full-time academic standing, I worked in a high-demand cardiology clinic where I played a key role in its expansion from two to five locations. I contributed to clinical operations by standardizing MA training, managing staffing logistics, and implementing workflow improvements. I served as a central resource for team support, advocated for underserved patients, and helped ensure a positive, communicative care environment.

**Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA)**  
_Fourth District CASA Program_  
_Nov 2024 – Ongoing_  
As a CASA volunteer, I advocate for the best interests of two children involved in a long-term DCFS case, supporting their emotional well-being through regular visits. I build trusting relationships, guide them toward their goals, and report case insights and recommendations to their Guardian ad Litem.

**Youth Group Advisor**  
_Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints_  
_May 2023 – Ongoing_  
I mentor young men (ages 15–18), fostering personal growth, leadership, and service. I organize activities ranging from service visits to career workshops and outdoor expeditions to promote teamwork, integrity, and character development.

**Engin Buddy – English Teacher**  
_Engin Program_  
_Mar 2023 – Oct 2023_  
I taught conversational English virtually to a Ukrainian student, creating tailored lessons and interactive discussions to improve language fluency, confidence, and cross-cultural connection.

**Health & Materials Secretary**  
_Colombia Bogotá North Mission_  
_Sep 2019 – Feb 2020_  
I managed the health needs of 180–220 missionaries across five Colombian states, coordinating emergency care, mental health support, and insurance logistics. I also oversaw distribution of medical supplies and delivered health education on hygiene and disease prevention in a foreign environment.

# Research Experience

**Isolation and characterization of a novel bacteriophage against a multi drug-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa**  
_UVU, College of Science – with Dr. Ruhul Kuddus_  
_Aug 2024 – Ongoing_  
Under the mentorship of Dr. Ruhul Kuddus, I am participating in conducting research focused on isolating and characterizing a bacteriophage capable of targeting multidrug-resistant *P. aeruginosa*. To date, we have isolated and purified a novel phage and completed preliminary host range assays, genomic sequencing, and morphological analysis (via electron microscopy at BYU). Ongoing and future work includes further genomic and phenotypic characterization, with plans to submit a manuscript to *Frontiers in Microbiology*.

**Expression of wheat oxalate oxidase in Bacillus subtilis to protect American Chestnuts from Cryphonectria parasitica**  
_UVU, College of Science – with Dr. Margie Beucher_  
_Jan 2025 – Ongoing_  
Collaborating with Dr. Margie Beucher and peers, helped develop a research project aimed at genetically modifying *Bacillus subtilis* to express a protective gene within the American Chestnut tree, combating Chestnut Blight. We are currently executing bacterial transformation experiments and will progress to testing for endophytic potential and gene expression. The work incorporates genomic analysis, protein expression techniques, and plant microbiome research.
